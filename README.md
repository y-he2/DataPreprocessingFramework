# Efficient-Python-Data-Signal-ML-Lab-Framework

* This is a framework which Im progressively improving, during the use as a lab enviroment for my brainstorming experiments. 
* Its based on Pandas, Dask/Ray, Numpy, Scipy, Keras, Tensorflow/Pytorch etc. 
* It could enable efficient data and signal processing, feature engineering and machine learning. 
* Main features including:
  * mp_utility: A Multiprocessing based shared memory 3D tensor apply function. Can be used to apply any function over the last 2 axis, parallelized over the first axis. 
  * signal_utility: Contains various useful functions for processing signals stored in Numpy/Scipy/Pandas.
  * preprocessor.py: some Pandas helper. 

I uploaded them in a rush so theres currently no explaination nor documentation. 
Currently the lab enviroment is not live on Github so I may rip this repo and recreate a proper one.
